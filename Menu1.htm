you are playing with a bad team, definitely you will be at a disadvantage no
matter how good you are. So, try to analyze how your mobile performs. For
example, if you have lag or if your phone does not have the speed it should
when there are many players playing at the same time or if you are playing 1 vs
1. If this is the case, try to play on the PC. Both FPS, fluency and even the
connection should go much better. And simply with this change, once you get
used to it and once you configure the controls well, you’ll have the chance to
kill a lot more.</span></p>
